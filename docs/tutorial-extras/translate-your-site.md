# SOLID Principles

SOLID is a set of principles that were design by Robert Martin in the
essay [Design Principles and Design Patterns](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155800/http:/www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf). In this essay he describes that a successful software is going to require
change and is going to have a need to be develop further, without any sort of guidelines or principles the software is going to become rigid, fragile, time-consuming and unable to change.[^1]

So SOLID provide a set of mental guidelines that help developers on how they should **think** about their code while they are developing software thinking in the long-term gains rather than the short term benefits of _hacky_ code.

This principles focus on reducing the dependencies of the developer on tool and frameworks making it easier to collaborate without impacting other developers, it also increases reliability in the software since this principles promotes code that is easily testable while still making it much more easier to maintain and extend
