# Overview

[git](https://git-scm.com) is a distributed version-control system that track changes in computer files and coordinate that work among multiple people.

You do not required to store all the files in a central store, you have clones of the copy of the repository and has the entire history of the project in those clones.

You can self-host a server to store the code and it's metadata like:

- [Gitlab CE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ce)
- [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
- [GitBucket](https://gitbucket.github.io)
- [Gogs](https://gogs.io)

Or use third-party service like:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com)
