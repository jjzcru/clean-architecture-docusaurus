# Clean Architecture Fundamentals

This is a introductory course that teaches developer how to build scalable application and also how they can collaborate with each other.

The course is composed of 5 parts:

## 1. [SOLID](/docs/category/solid)

In this chapter we are going to introduce guiding principles that work as a foundation on how to _think_ when we are solving problems, specially those related to OOP.

This principles are applicable regardless of the programming language, project or company culture.

## 2. [Design Patterns](/docs/category/design-patterns)

In this chapter we are going to learn about design patterns, different types, example of each type and when and how to use them.

## 3. [The Twelve-Factor App](/docs/twelve-factor-app)

This is a methodology that provides a set of principles for building SaSS applications, which could be monolithic or micro-services. This principles makes software easy to build and customized on different environment without the need to refactor or change our code.

## 4. [Clean Architecture](/docs/category/clean-architecture)

Using the concepts from previous chapters we are going to bring them all together and use them in an architecture that helps us build software by focusing on the use cases that the application need to perform instead of technological decisions (implementation details).

Is a shift of mentality that focus on the _behavior_ of the program rather than the final implementation.

## 5. [Git](/docs/category/git)

Since we build software collaboratively, in this chapter we are going to learn what git is and how to use it, and we are also going to learn a branching model for developing software.
